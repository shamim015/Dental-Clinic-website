                                            Visiting the dentist regularly will not only help keep your teeth and mouth healthy, but will also help keep the rest of your body healthy. Dental care is important because it:

                                            Helps prevent tooth decay
                                            Protects against periodontal (gum) disease, which can lead to tooth and bone loss
                                            Prevents bad breath – brushing, flossing, and seeing the dentist regularly will help reduce the amount of bacteria in your mouth that causes bad breath
                                            Gives you a more attractive smile and increases your self-confidence
                                            Helps keep teeth looking bright by preventing them from becoming stained by food, drinks, and tobacco
                                            Strengthens your teeth so that you can enjoy healthy, beautiful smiles for the rest of your life!</p>

Your smile’s appearance is important, and your dentist can help keep your smile healthy and looking beautiful. With so many advances in dentistry, you no longer have to settle for stained, chipped, missing, or misshapen teeth. Today’s dentists offer many treatment choices that can help you smile with confidence, including:

                                            Professional teeth whitening
                                            Fillings that mimic the appearance of natural teeth
                                            Tooth replacement and full smile makeovers</p>

During your first visit, you should be able to determine whether the dentist is right for you. During your appointment, consider the following:

                                        Is the appointment schedule convenient?
                                        Is the office easy to get to and close by?
                                        Does the office appear to be clean and orderly?
                                        Was your medical and dental history recorded and placed in a permanent file?
                                        Does the dentist explain techniques for good oral health?
                                        Is information about cost presented to you before treatment is scheduled?
                                        Is your dentist a member of the ADA (American Dental Association)?</p>

                                        Always remember to brush your teeth at least two times a day, and floss at least once!
                                        Make sure to use toothpaste that contains fluoride, and ask your dentist if you need a fluoride rinse. This will help prevent cavities.
                                        Avoid foods with a lot of sugar (sugar increases the amount of bacteria that grows in your mouth causing more plaque and possibly cavities) and avoid tobacco (this can stain your teeth, cause gum disease, and eventually lead to oral cancer).
                                        Don’t be afraid to brush your tongue! By brushing your tongue, you will remove food particles and reduce the amount of plaque-causing bacteria. Tongue brushing also helps keep your breath fresh.
                                        Be sure to schedule your routine checkup. It is recommended that you visit the dentist every six months.
